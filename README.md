# Malawi-Flood-Prediction
This Notebook represents Our solution (Placed 6/480) for the Zindi Competition : 
UNICEF Arm 2030 Vision : Flood Prediction in Malawi.

The external Data we used was in Shapefile Format : a special Format for GeoSpatial data.
The Processing of These datasets was done Using DivaGIS Software and GeoPandas Library.

This is My first experience dealing with GeoSpatial Data, I hope you enjoy it Just Like I did !!!
